About Me
======

I am in my 5th year in the Cognitive & Behavioral Neuroscience PhD program at George Mason University. My research interests are investigating the neural bases of decision-making in human prefrontal cortex. I am specifically interested in how disassociable yet overlapping networks that signal sensory and limbic information converge in the prefrontal cortex and how these networks give rise to adaptive behavior. The methods I utilize in my research include behavioral paradigms, computational modeling, electroencephalography (EEG), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

I am also a Predoctoral Fellow through the National Science Foundation Research Traineeship Program (NSF NRT) through the Center for Adaptive Systems of Brain-Body Interactions. Through the NRT, I co-founded the IMPACT-PD Project that focuses on developing a user-friendly communication interface for people with Parkinson's disease, their carepartners, and healthcare team. The IMPACT-PD Project also focuses on improving measures of remote data collection, especially for non-motor symptoms, and developing a Continuing Education (CE) course for non-neurologist health providers.

In my spare time, I enjoy knitting, tinkering with computers, fashion, videogames, hiking, and spending time with my family. I previously did professional stints with the Kennedy Center Honors for a few years.

I am an avid pro-wrestling fan. My favorite pro-wrestlers are Shawn Michaels, Becky Lynch, Sting, MJF, Malakai Black, Cody Rhodes, and Undertaker.
